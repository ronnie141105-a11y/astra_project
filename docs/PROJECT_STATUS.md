> **Reorganized by architecture review, July 2026.** The original Phase 3
> ("hotspot detection") conflated stateless spatial clustering with the
> stateful problem of tracking a 4DARHAC's identity across prediction
> horizons and poll cycles. It has been split into Phases 3–6. See
> `docs/architecture.md §6` for the domain model
> (`Cluster` / `ComplexityRegion` / `FourDArhac`) and full rationale.

> **Note on `main.py`.** The "`main.py` deliberately left as a Phase 1
> demonstration only" bullets under Milestones 5–7 below describe
> `main.py`'s status *at the time those milestones were built* — that
> was a deliberate, reviewed choice to keep each milestone's demo
> isolated (`demo_tracking.py`, `demo_forecast.py`, `demo_resolution.py`)
> rather than repeatedly reworking the shared entry point. Milestone 8
> below is where `main.py` was finally wired to the full pipeline via
> `astra.pipeline.Pipeline`, becoming ASTRA's real application entry
> point.

- `astra/utils/geodesy.py` — haversine distance, bearing, dead-reckoning
- Dependency injection via `ConnectorProtocol`
- `demo_phase1.py` — offline Phase 1 demonstration

## Milestone 2 — Trajectory Prediction ✅ Complete

- `astra/trajectory/models.py` — `PredictedSnapshot`, `PredictionResult`

  constant-velocity trajectory prediction
- Prediction horizons: 5, 10, 15, 30, 60 minutes
- `demo_trajectory.py` — offline Phase 2 demonstration

## Milestone 3 — Cluster Detection ✅ Complete

- `astra/hotspot/distance.py` — precomputed horizontal+vertical-gated
  distance matrix for DBSCAN
- `astra/hotspot/models.py` — `Cluster` (frozen, per-instant, no
  cross-cycle identity)
- `astra/hotspot/engine.py` — `ClusterEngine.detect()` /`.detect_all()`
- Design rationale: `docs/milestone_3_hotspot.md`
- Verification: `tests/test_hotspot.py` — 24/24 checks pass
- `demo_hotspot.py` — persistent + transient cluster scenarios across
  the observed snapshot and every predicted horizon

## Milestone 4 — Complexity Assessment ✅ Complete

- `astra/complexity/stats.py` — circular/linear standard deviation
- `astra/complexity/conflict.py` — CPA-based MTCA/LTCA pairwise counting
- `astra/complexity/models.py` — `ComplexityRegion` (composes `Cluster`)
- `astra/complexity/engine.py` — `ComplexityEngine.assess()` /
  `.assess_many()`, 0–100 weighted-combination scoring
- `astra.utils.geodesy.local_tangent_plane_nm` — CPA projection helper
- `ASTRAConfig` — MTCA/LTCA thresholds, normalisation references,
  combination weights (validated to sum to 1.0)
- Design rationale: `docs/milestone_4_complexity.md`
- Verification: `tests/test_complexity.py` — 42/42 checks pass
- `demo_complexity.py` — high- vs. low-complexity scenario across the
  observed snapshot and every predicted horizon

## Milestone 5 — 4DARHAC Detection / Tracking ✅ Complete

- `astra/tracking/models.py` — `FourDArhac` (mutable, stateful),
  `ArhacStatus` lifecycle literal
- `astra/tracking/association.py` — pure Jaccard-similarity and
  centroid/extent-overlap match heuristics
- `astra/tracking/engine.py` — `TrackerEngine.update()`, the pipeline's
  first stateful component: holds open tracks across poll cycles,
  associates new observations, derives lifecycle status from the
  `complexity_score` trend, closes stale tracks
- `ASTRAConfig` — `tracking_jaccard_threshold`, `tracking_stale_cycles`,
  `tracking_confirm_cycles`, `tracking_trend_tolerance` (all validated)
- Design rationale, including the three concrete decisions made beyond
  the original build plan (horizon-0-only identity, greedy one-to-one
  association, trend-based status FSM): `docs/milestone_5_tracking.md`
- Verification: `tests/test_tracking.py` — 44/44 checks pass
- `demo_tracking.py` — scripted multi-poll-cycle scenario walking a
  `FourDArhac` through its full lifecycle (`CANDIDATE → CONFIRMED →
  GROWING → PEAK → DISSIPATING → CLOSED`)
- `main.py` deliberately left as a Phase 1 demonstration only, matching
  the precedent set by Milestones 2–4 (see `docs/milestone_5_tracking.md`
  "`main.py` — deliberately not integrated")

## Milestone 6 — 4DARHAC Forecast ✅ Complete

- `astra/forecast/horizon_series.py` — pure: builds a track's per-cycle
  `(time_s, complexity_score)` series (observed anchor + matched
  predicted horizons), reusing `astra.tracking.association.best_cluster_match`
- `astra/forecast/projection.py` — pure: `linear_crossing_time()`,
  `predicted_peak()`
- `astra/forecast/engine.py` — `ForecastEngine.forecast()` /
  `.forecast_many()`, stateless; mutates the `FourDArhac` objects
  `TrackerEngine` owns after `TrackerEngine.update()` runs each cycle
- `astra/tracking/models.py` — `FourDArhac` gains two fields beyond the
  Milestone 5 schema: `predicted_peak_time_s` and
  `forecast_urgency_rank` (kept separate from `priority`, see
  `docs/milestone_6_forecast.md` OQ-4)
- `ASTRAConfig` — `forecast_onset_threshold`,
  `forecast_dissipation_threshold`, `forecast_min_matched_horizons`,
  `forecast_confidence_decay_s` (all validated)
- Design rationale, including the five design decisions resolved from
  the original design review and one real defect found while
  integrating `demo_forecast.py`: `docs/milestone_6_forecast.md`
- Verification: `tests/test_forecast.py` — 47/47 checks pass
- `demo_forecast.py` — extends `demo_tracking.py`'s scripted scenario
  with onset/dissipation/peak-time/confidence/urgency-rank output
  alongside the existing trend status
- `main.py` deliberately left as a Phase 1 demonstration only, matching
  the precedent set by Milestones 2–5

## Milestone 7 — AI Resolution Framework ✅ Complete

- `astra/resolution/models.py` — `ResolutionCandidate`,
  `ResolutionSet` (composes `FourDArhac`, not a field on it)
- `astra/resolution/candidates.py` — pure: `select_target_aircraft()`,
  `heading_lever_applicable()`, `generate_candidates()` (speed / FL
  always; heading only when a conflict component is present); builds
  hypothetical `TrafficSnapshot`s, never mutates the live one
- `astra/resolution/engine.py` — `ResolutionEngine.resolve()` /
  `.resolve_many()`, stateless; evaluates each candidate by replaying
  `TrajectoryEngine` → `ClusterEngine` → `ComplexityEngine` on the
  hypothetical snapshot at the track's single closest horizon to
  `predicted_onset_s`, then re-associates via
  `astra.tracking.association.best_cluster_match`
- `ASTRAConfig` — `resolution_speed_step_kt`,
  `resolution_altitude_step_ft`, `resolution_heading_step_deg`,
  `resolution_weight_complexity/domino/deviation/fuel` (validated to
  sum to `1.0`), `resolution_max_tracks_per_cycle` (all validated)
- Design rationale, including the five design decisions resolved from
  the original design review and the pre-formal-test smoke test that
  confirmed pipeline wiring: `docs/milestone_7_resolution.md`
- Verification: `tests/test_resolution.py` — 47/47 checks pass
- `demo_resolution.py` — extends `demo_forecast.py`'s scripted scenario
  with a converging 3-aircraft geometry that crosses the forecast onset
  threshold on its 5-minute predicted horizon, printing
  `ResolutionEngine`'s ranked candidate clearances each cycle
- `main.py` deliberately left as a Phase 1 demonstration only, matching
  the precedent set by Milestones 2–6

### Milestone 7 follow-up — domino-effect scoring & expanded search (this session)

Improved the deterministic `ResolutionEngine` in place; architecture,
public API shapes, and the "one horizon, replay the existing pipeline"
approach are all unchanged.

- **Domino-effect evaluation** — `ResolutionEngine._domino_cost()`
  re-clusters the *entire* hypothetical snapshot at the evaluated
  horizon (not just the track's own matched cluster), then compares
  every other resulting cluster against this cycle's real regions at
  that horizon: a hypothetical cluster that matches an existing region
  only penalises a *worsening* (`after - before`, clipped to `>= 0`);
  one that matches nothing is treated as a brand-new hotspot and its
  full `complexity_score` counts. Contributions sum in raw 0–100
  `complexity_score` units and are normalised to `[0, 1]` by dividing
  by 100. Surfaced as `ResolutionCandidate.domino_cost_norm` and
  subtracted from `resolution_score` at weight `resolution_weight_domino`.
- **Expanded candidate generation** — `generate_candidates()` now
  builds *both* signed directions (increase/decrease speed, climb/
  descend, left/right heading) for every applicable lever instead of
  one fixed direction, widening the search from up to 3 candidates per
  track to up to 6 (4 without a conflict driver, since heading is still
  only generated when `heading_lever_applicable`). Still a fixed,
  deterministic enumeration over `ASTRAConfig`'s existing step sizes —
  no randomness, no optimisation library.
- **Rebalanced scoring weights** — `resolution_weight_complexity`
  0.6 → **0.55**, new `resolution_weight_domino` **0.20**,
  `resolution_weight_deviation` 0.25 → **0.15**,
  `resolution_weight_fuel` 0.15 → **0.10** (still validated to sum to
  `1.0` in `ASTRAConfig.__post_init__`).
- `ResolutionCandidate` gained `domino_cost_norm: float = 0.0` (default
  keeps positional-argument construction from before this change
  working unchanged). Exposed through
  `astra.dashboard.serializers.serialize_resolution_candidate()` as
  `"domino_cost_norm"` in the JSON payload.
- Verification: `tests/test_resolution.py` grew from 39 to 47 checks
  (both-direction candidate coverage, `domino_cost_norm` bounds);
  `tests/test_dashboard.py` grew from 81 to 82 checks
  (`domino_cost_norm` round-trips through the serializer). Full
  regression suite (Milestones 3–9 combined, including
  `tests/test_interface.py`): **304/304 checks pass**, no behavioural
  regressions elsewhere.
- **Scope note (unchanged decision):** the engine remains fully
  deterministic. Reinforcement learning (e.g. PPO) was considered and
  is intentionally **not** implemented in this prototype — the data,
  compute, and simulation-fidelity requirements for training an RL
  policy are out of scope for a thesis-timeline project; it remains
  documented future work (see "Remaining work" below), not a planned
  replacement for `ResolutionEngine`.

## Milestone 8 — Dashboard / HMI ✅ Complete

- `astra/pipeline.py` — small, in-scope fix found while verifying the
  Milestone 8 design review's assumptions: `CycleResult` now also
  carries the raw `PredictionResult` (not just the derived
  `ComplexityRegion`s), computed once and threaded through, so a
  presentation layer can render predicted aircraft positions without
  recomputing anything.
- `astra/dashboard/models.py` — `DashboardSnapshot`, the dashboard's own
  tiny read-model (latest `CycleResult`, cycle count, staleness)
- `astra/dashboard/store.py` — `CycleStore`, the one new concurrency
  primitive this milestone introduces: a lock around "the last
  `CycleResult`", written by `main.py`'s poll loop and read by Flask's
  request-handling thread(s)
- `astra/dashboard/serializers.py` — pure functions turning Milestone
  1–7 domain objects into JSON; the only new "logic" module
- `astra/dashboard/routes.py` / `server.py` — a minimal Flask app
  (`/` HMI shell, `/state` JSON) that never imports an engine or the
  `Pipeline` directly, only `CycleStore` + `serializers`
- `astra/dashboard/templates/index.html`, `static/css/dashboard.css`,
  `static/js/dashboard.js` — the HMI screen itself: a canvas plan-view
  (observed traffic, dashed predicted trajectories, complexity-heatmap
  circles), a 4DARHAC hotspot table, an onset/peak/dissipation timeline
  per track, and a ranked-resolution-candidates panel. Auto-updates by
  polling `/state` every `poll_interval_s` (served by the backend, not
  hard-coded in the frontend)
- `ASTRAConfig` — `dashboard_host`, `dashboard_port`,
  `dashboard_max_resolution_candidates_shown` (all validated)
- `main.py` — now the real application entry point: runs
  `Pipeline.run_cycle()` every poll cycle, publishes each `CycleResult`
  into a `CycleStore`, and starts the dashboard's Flask server in a
  background thread (`--no-dashboard` to opt out and keep the
  console-only loop)
- Design decisions resolved from the design review (module layout,
  `main.py` as the live-loop owner, the resolution-candidate display
  cap, the live-only heatmap, polling as the update mechanism) and the
  clean API boundary that lets a future BlueSky live run or RL-based
  `ResolutionEngine` plug in without touching dashboard code:
  `docs/milestone_8_dashboard.md`
- Verification: `tests/test_dashboard.py` — 70/70 checks pass (pure
  serializer unit tests + `Pipeline`/`CycleStore`/Flask `test_client`
  integration checks); full regression suite (Milestones 3–8 combined,
  `test_hotspot.py` + `test_complexity.py` + `test_tracking.py` +
  `test_forecast.py` + `test_resolution.py` + `test_dashboard.py`):
  266/266 checks pass
- Live demonstration: `python main.py --mock` — no separate
  `demo_dashboard.py` was added, since `main.py` *is* Milestone 8's
  live, browser-visible demonstration (open `http://127.0.0.1:8050/`
  while it runs)

## Milestone 9 — Sector Complexity & HMI Redesign ✅ Complete

- `astra/resolution/models.py` / `engine.py` — `ResolutionCandidate`
  now also carries `complexity_before_components`,
  `complexity_after_components`, and `hypothetical_prediction`
  (previously computed then discarded inside `_evaluate()`)
- `astra/complexity/sector.py` (new) — `SectorComplexityEngine`, which
  reuses the unmodified `ComplexityEngine` on a synthetic per-sector
  `Cluster` each cycle, plus a rolling per-sector history buffer
- `astra/utils/config.py` — `SectorDefinition` (circular sector),
  `ASTRAConfig.sectors` (opt-in, empty by default),
  `sector_bucket_s`, `sector_history_buckets` (all validated)
- `astra/pipeline.py` — owns one `SectorComplexityEngine`;
  `CycleResult` gained `sector_regions` / `sector_history`
  (`default_factory=dict`, no signature break)
- `astra/dashboard/serializers.py` — serializes all of the above;
  `/state`'s top-level payload gained `sector_regions` / `sector_history`
- `astra/dashboard/{index.html,dashboard.css,dashboard.js}` — full
  frontend rewrite: a tabbed HMI (Operations / Sector Complexity) with
  a time-horizon map scrubber, an Alerts table (onset/act-by/confidence/
  sector), an Event & Dissipation panel (confidence ring, before/after
  complexity, ranked candidates with a client-side solution lifecycle,
  before/after component bars, what-if vertical/horizontal profiles),
  a coordination-steps disclosure, and per-sector complexity charts
- Design rationale, exact data-shape changes, and documented
  simplifications (circular sectors, ephemeral client-side lifecycle,
  no pre-configured sectors, "Act by" approximation):
  `docs/milestone_9_hmi.md`
- Verification: `tests/test_sector.py` (new, 11/11), extended
  `test_dashboard.py` (81/81, was 70), full regression suite
  (Milestones 3–9 combined): **288/288 checks pass**. Frontend verified
  headlessly with `jsdom` against a real `/state` payload (poll cycle,
  candidate/lifecycle/tab/scrubber interactions) — zero runtime errors.
- Live demonstration: `python main.py --mock` (unchanged entry point;
  sector tab shows its "not configured" placeholder unless
  `ASTRAConfig.sectors` is populated)

## Remaining work

**All 9 milestones are complete.** No further work is currently
planned for this prototype. Natural next steps, out of scope for this
prototype and explicitly not started: a live-BlueSky
demonstration run (vs. today's mock-mode demonstrations), a
persisted/multi-user solution lifecycle, and real polygon
sectorization in place of the circular `SectorDefinition` approximation.

An RL-based (e.g. PPO) `ResolutionEngine` replacement or supplement was
considered and deliberately **not** implemented — see "Milestone 7
follow-up" above. `ResolutionEngine` stays fully deterministic by
design; RL is documented future work only, scoped out for this
thesis-timeline prototype due to data, compute, and simulation-fidelity
constraints, not a pending task.
